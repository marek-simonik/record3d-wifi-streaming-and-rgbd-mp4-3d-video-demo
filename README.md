# [Record3D](https://record3d.app)'s Wi-Fi Streaming & RGBD mp4 3D Video Demo

This is a demo project for the [Record3D](https://record3d.app) iOS app. [Click here to test it](https://marek-simonik.github.io/record3d-wifi-streaming-and-rgbd-mp4-3d-video-demo/). 

This demo will allow you to:
 
- Replay your exported RGBD mp4 Videos, which are very small compared to the native 3D Videos (at the cost of added noise).
- Live-stream 3D Videos into your browser on your local Wi-Fi network (i.e. NOT over the Internet).

To use Wi-Fi Streaming and RGBD Video export, you will need to purchase the Wi-Fi Streaming & RGBD Videos Extension Pack.

*See also [this simple streaming demo project](https://github.com/marek-simonik/record3d-simple-wifi-streaming-demo) for more details.*

Here you can see how to replay exported RGBD mp4 files in 3D:
